## Monday 1/17/22

#### 1. Follow the github course, you can find it [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)
* Completed

***
#### 2. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A37-3lflh8I) video
* Data types:
     * Bool => Boolean
     * Char => Character
     * String => String of characters
     * Int => Integer
     * Float => floating point value
     * Array => Group of data type
     
***
#### 3. Read [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math)
* Type of numbers:
  * Integers are floating-point numbers without a fraction. They can either be positive or negative.
  * Floating point numbers (floats) have decimal points and decimal places,
  * Doubles are a specific type of floating point number that have greater precision than standard floating point numbers
* note: number type for verly large integers, [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/BigInt)

##### Converting to number data types
```
let myNumber = '74';
Number(myNumber);
```
* Arithmetic Operators
  |Operator|Name            |
  |:-: |         :-:        |
  | +  | Addition           |
  | -  | Substraction       |
  | *  | Multiplication     |
  | /  | Division           |
  | %  | Remainder (modulo) | 
  | ** | Exponent           |
  
  
* Operator Precedence
  * Follows same rules as Math

* Increment and Decrement operators
Sometimes you'll want to repeatedly add or subtract one to or from a numeric variable value. This can be conveniently done using the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators. You can only increment an existing variable.

* Assignment operators
  |Operator|Name                    |
  |:-:  |         :-:               |
  | =   | assigment                 |
  | +=  | addition assignment       |
  | -=  | Substraction assignment   |
  | \*= | Multiplication assignment |
  | /=  | Division assignment       | 
  
* Comparison Operators
  |Operator|Name                    |
  |:-:  |         :-:               |
  | === | Strict equality           |
  | !== | Strict-non-equality       |
  | <   | Less than                 |
  | >   | Greater than              |
  | <=  | Less than or equal to     |
  | >=  | Greater than or equal to  |
